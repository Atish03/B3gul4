The first thing we do is run a scan on the IP to find any open ports. Here I have used <code>ferroxbuster</code> to scan the IP and the results are as follows:
<pre><code>
200      GET      189l      643w     7853c http://10.10.116.41/

301      GET        9l       28w      313c http://10.10.116.41/assets => http://10.10.116.41/assets/

403      GET        9l       28w      277c http://10.10.116.41/server-status
</code></pre>
Here we see a <code>assets</code> directory which contains files related to the webpage, we find the following in that directory:
<br><br><img src="assets/assets.png"><br><br>
On inspecting the style.css we find another directory name <code>/sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php</code> when we go to that site we get the following popup:
<br><br><img src="assets/popup.png"><br><br>
We then disable the javascript and find out a rickroll video on the webpage. After playing the video we hear a voice saying <code><i>I’ll put you out of your misery you’re looking in the wrong place</i></code>
And a burping sound in middle. This hints us to use <code>Burpsuit</code>.<br><br>
